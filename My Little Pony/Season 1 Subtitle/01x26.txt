I... can't... believe... the Grand...
Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
Pinkie! Please stop shouting.
I'm trying to concentrate.
Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now.
It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to
let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
What's Twilight doing?
She's got an awesome magic spell
she's been working on for the Gala.
Where are the others? It's getting late.
Hold your horses, girl. We're here.
Perfect! I'm ready.
For what?
All right, Spike.
An apple!
Are we having pie?
Shh! Watch!
Thanks. But that's just the start.
Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
Yes.
Will they be safe, Twilight?
You have my word.
Ta-da!
Neat, huh? And don't worry.
They'll be mice again at midnight.
Opalescence, no!
Wait! Come back!
Those horses were supposed to
pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
What ever shall we do?
Uh... ahem. Excuse me.
Uh, would you boys mind
pulling our carriage to the Gala?
Oh. Yeah.
Right.
Come on, you guys.
Let me in!
Sure thing, Spike.
Heavens no! We're getting dressed.
Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh...
we don't normally wear clothes.
I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.
I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight.
Our home town, Twilight!
And he best part is that we all get to
hang out together all night long!
Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.
We'll just have to see.
We're gonna be a mite busy.
Busy having fun!
Oh. Okay.
Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to
spend some time together.
Great!
Cause I planned out my
insider's tour of Canterlot.
I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels.
And Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree.
And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.
Then let's get moving! Hyah!
Excuse me!?
Um... I...
If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity...
Wow!
You all look...
...amazing!
I can't believe we're finally here!
With all that we've imagined, the reality
of this night is sure to make this...
...the best night ever!

You know why? Cause we're all gonna
spend time at the Gala to...
...gether.
Or not.
Princess Celestia!
Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.
Oh, I'm so excited to be here!
We have so much to catch up on.
Well, I want you right by
my side the entire evening...
...so we'll have plenty of time together.
That's just what I was hoping you'd say.
Hurry, Rarity...
Oh, but not too fast.
But don't wanna lose him...
WAIT!
Have to play it cool.
Oh, but don't be cold!
I can't lose him, I can't!
He's everything I imagined!
Even better than I imagined.
Oh my! A meadowlark!
I think she's calling to me.
It's exactly what I wished for!
Howdy, partner! You hungry?
As a horse!
Well, what's you're hungering for?
Caramel apple? Apple pie?
Apple fritter? Apple fries?
I'll take that big apple pie!
Well, thank you kindly, sir!
Yeehaw! In the first minute.
I made my first sale. Just like I expected.
Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin'?
Yeah!
Mmmyyy pppiiieee!
You saved it! Thanks.
Hey, no prob.
Hey! I know you.
You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale
and won The Best Flyer Competition.
Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
Well, Rainbow Dash.
Looks like your skills saved us again.
Oh, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie.
Yeah...
Wanna come hang out with us?
Sure. Why not?
I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts!
The shiny dance floor...
The pretty party ponies...
The fancy band...
Shiny! Pretty! Fancy!
GOTTA DANCE!
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala</i>
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping Gaalaaa!</i>
<i>It's all I ever dreamed</i>
<i>It's all I ever dreamed! Woohoo!
It's all I ever dreamed! Yippee!</i>
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaAAAA!</i>
It's all I've ever... dreamed?
Well, hello.
I am Prince Blueblood.
I am... Rarity.
Oh my, what a lovely rose.
You mean...
...this rose?
Thank you. It goes with my eyes.
My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
Was that you?
Yep! I love whistlin' while I work.
Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.
Oh!
I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey!
And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?
Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.
Hey, Spitfire!
You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?
You ever soared past lighting? It's awesome!
Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.
Princess! I've been so excited
to spend time with you and...
Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening!
Welcome to the Gala.
...which is why I...
Ladies! Lovely to see you again.
Looks like getting a chance to talk to
the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.
First minute, first sale.
Second...
Fourth...
Sixth...
Sixtieth minute... no sales.
This ain't what I expected at all.
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala...
...and it's not what I dreamed.
This isn't at all what I imagined.
This isn't what I hoped.
This isn't hanging out.
This isn't what I wished for.
No!
I waited all my life...
...for this moment.
And I'm not going to...
...let it slip by.
If it's the last thing I do...
...I'm gonna make this...
...the best night ever!
I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.
I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends!
But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
Gotcha!
It's okay. I promise not to hurt you.
I just wanna be your...
...friend?
Mmm... Sounds good to me.
Come on, Rainbow!
If they don't notice you,
you gotta make them notice you.
Just give him a chance, Rarity.
His princely side is sure to come out
if you're just patient.
Miss Rarity! Stop!
Oh.
Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
One would hate to slip.
Yes. "One" certainly would.
One's cloak should take care of the problem.
Oh, of course it will.
Come on everypony!
I know what will make you
shake those groove-thangs!
<i>You reach your right hoof in
You reach your right hoof out</i>
<i>You reach your right hoof in
And you shake it all about</i>
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Meeting lots of folks with clout</i>
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>
<i>You step your left hoof in
You pull it right back out</i>
<i>You step your left hoof in
But you better help him out</i>
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
But you'd find a different route</i>
<i>That's what it's all about</i>
<i>You kick your back leg in
You pull your back leg out</i>
<i>You reach your back leg in
Just be brave and have no doubt</i>
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Feeling like you're gonna pout</i>
<i>That's what I'm singing about</i>
<i>You tilt your head in
You tilt your head out</i>
<i>You tilt your head in
Then you shake it all about</i>
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Even though your date's a lout</i>
<i>You're better off without</i>
<i>You stomp your whole self in
You stomp your whole self out</i>
<i>You stomp your whole self in
And you stomp yourself about</i>
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
And you give a little shout</i>
COME OUT!
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey</i>
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
And that's what it's all about</i>
YEAH!
Young lady, this is not *that* kind of partay.
Ooooooh...
They don't want a party.
These ponies want a paaartaaay!
Two apple fritters, please.
Two apple fritters comin' right up.
That'll be four bits.
I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?
It's okay, Rarity.
I got you covered.
Thank you, Applejack. At least
somepony here has good manners.
Oh!
Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples!
My royal lips have touched common carnival fare!
I'm going to the buffet for
some... hors d'oeuvres.
Well, no wonder nopony wants my food.
They're fillin' up on all those
fancy-schmancy vittles.
Well, my down-home apples are
plenty good enough for this crowd.
I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.
I'll catch you yet, my pretties.
Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds
or monkeys or bears touches this net...
...you'll be MINE! MINE!!!
Come on, everypony!
You wanted a partay?
Now it's paaartaaay!
Yeah!
Now that's a beat, yeah!
C'mon, dance!
Yeah, woohoo!
Okay, all you high-class ponies.
Here's a highfalutin apple cake for
all your hoity-toity taste buds.
STAGE DIVE!
You, sir, are the most UNCHARMING
prince I have EVER MET!
Seems like the only thing royal about you
is that you are a ROYAL PAIN!
Ewww...!
Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!
Afraid to get DIRTY?!
This is my chance!
Yes!
Well... it can't get any worse.
You're... going to LOVE ME!!!
Run.
Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper!
Now your prince is sure to find you.
No!
Let's go!
Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.
Don't you think you've had enough?
Another donut! Extra sprinkles!
Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha.
Long time no see.
Hey, how was the Gala?
How was your best night ever?
That sounds like the worst night ever!
It was!
I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset
at us for ruining the Gala.
That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!
Princess Celestia?!
Pardon me, Princess...
...but tonight was just awful.
Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala
is always awful.
It is?
That is why I was thrilled you were all attending.
I was hoping you could liven things up a bit.
And while the evening may not
have gone as you planned...
...I'm sure you'll agree that in the end...
...it didn't turn out so bad
for this group of friends.
You're right, Princess.
Friends have a way of making even the worst
of times into something pretty great.
Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
-Talking!
-Laughing!
You mean doing exactly what
I wanted to do the whole time?
Yes, Spike. You were right.
As horrible as our night was...
...being together here has made it all better.
In fact, it's made it...
...the best night ever!
